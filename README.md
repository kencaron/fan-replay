fan-replay (frontend)
=====================

This is a simple demo that uses [angular-masonry](https://github.com/passy/angular-masonry) and [ui-bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)'s Modal and Carousel directives.

This is a Sass/Compass project.  As a quick demo, I'm importing [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) stylesheets as needed. Currently imported: `variables`, `mixins`, `carousel`, and `modal`


----
## Set up
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

----
## Spin up a dev server
- `grunt serve`

----
## I want to write CSS
If you don't have Compass:

- `gem install compass`

Then

- `compass watch`
